## How to crreate spike projects
When spiking on something and in need to create projects or have code, create a folder in this directory (`/spike`) and give it a name basing on the activity you are spiking on. 

For example, if you're about to spike on how to create a web service in C#, you can create a folder called `webServices` and put everything in there about your spiking task on that topic.

> Drive the content in this folder by spiking topic!

### Basic rules
Please follow these general guidelines:

- Use [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) (first character in lower case) as naming convention for folders you create for your spiking activity.
- Depending on the language you code, use the naming convention standard for that code. If you are going to spike on a C# project, you should use Pascal.
- For each folder you create for your spiking activity, please add a `readme.md` and document your spiking. Doesn't have to be precise and detailed!
