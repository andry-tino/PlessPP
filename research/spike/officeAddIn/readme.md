Spiking on office add-ins.

## About
The spike is intended to verify the following:

- Can the add-in communicate with the external world?
- Can the add-in be reachable from outside?
- Can the add-in run safely when Power Point is in presentation mode?

### Questions
We want to answer to about:

- Changing slide programmatically.
- Changing slides programmatically when in presentation mode.
- Contacting the add-in from outside.
- Issuing a slide change command from outside.
- Issuing a slide change command from outside while in presentation mode.
