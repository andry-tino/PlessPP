# PlessPP
Presenterless PowerPoint - Change slides while presenting with natural gestures of your hands.

The project is part of the Microsoft Hackathon 2016 initiative.

## The idea
Have you ever given a presentation? Well, we guess you have! It's nice to give a presentation right? You prepare your slides, you rehearse, and then the day come and you get on stage: your PC is plugged, hopefully the projector won't go berserk, and there you go! Now you are speaking, talking and performing on stage but something is wrong... Yeah, **on your hand you have this remote controller** that you need to hold all the time in order to change slides!

_PlessPP_ enables users presenting slides using [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/powerpoint) to stand on stage and deliver their decks **without using wired/wireless controllers** in their hands. The whole point is removing those eval pieces of plastic from presenters' hands!

The project's motto is:

> Hold nothing, be free to present!

This will basically empower presenters to use their hands and their body to interact with the audiance without being hindred by stuff they need to hold in one hand.

## How it works
_PlessPP_ is for presenters and helps them delivering better presentations on stage. It will add nothing to your visuals, it will just free your presentations abilities.

1. **Pfrepare your presentation:** Make your presentation using PowerPoint.
2. **Wear your Band:** Put on your band on your wrist!
3. **Set up everything:** On your PC, start PowerPoint and enter presentation mode! Also remember to check the projector.
4. **Go on stage:** And make them wow!

Without the bloody controller in your hand, you are free to deliver your presentation using both hands. Body language is important, sacrificing one hand is no more necessary!
