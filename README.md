# PlessPP
Presenterless PowerPoint - Change slides while presenting with natural gestures of your hands.

The project is part of the Microsoft Hackathon 2016 initiative.

## The idea
_PlessPP_ enables users presenting slides using [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/powerpoint) to stand on stage and deliver their decks without using wired/wireless presenters in their hands. The whole point is removing those eval remote controllers from presenters' hands! The project's motto is:

> Hold nothing, be free to present!

This will basically empower presenters to use their hands and their body to interact with the audiance without being hindred by stuff they need to hold in one hand.
